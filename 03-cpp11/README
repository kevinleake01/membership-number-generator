*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

This section uses #include <random> from C++11, which means this
will require C++11 or later.


Here are some examples:

  g++ base64url.cpp; ./a.out > myfile0001.txt
  g++ rand-minstd.cpp; ./a.out 32 100 > myfile0002.txt
  g++ rand-mt19937-32.cpp; ./a.out 32 100 > myfile0003.txt
  g++ rand-seedseq-0001.cpp; ./a.out > myfile0004.txt
